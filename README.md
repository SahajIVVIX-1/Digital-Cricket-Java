Gameplay:

Batting: Simulate batting by allowing the user to choose a shot (e.g., defend, drive, six). Use Math.random() to generate a random outcome for each shot (runs scored, wicket lost, etc.).
Bowling: Let the user choose a bowling style (e.g., yorker, googly). Generate a random outcome based on the bowling style and user's batting choice.
Scoring: Keep track of runs scored, wickets lost, and overs bowled.
Tie-breakers: Implement a tie-breaker system (e.g., super over) if the scores are tied after the allotted overs.
Java Concepts:

Classes: Create classes for Players (batsman, bowler), Match, and Innings.
Methods: Implement methods for batting, bowling, scoring, and tie-breakers within their respective classes.
Random: Use java.util.Random class to generate random outcomes for shots and bowling.
Loops: Use loops to iterate through overs and innings.
Conditional statements (if-else): Use these to determine outcomes based on user choices and random generation.
Modular Design:

Separate functionalities into well-defined classes and methods for better code organization.
User Interface:

Use Scanner class to take user input for shots and bowling styles.
Print informative messages to guide the user through the game and display scores.
